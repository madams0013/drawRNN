# Guess What I'm Sketch'NN

This is the final Deep Learning Project for Laurie, Maddy, Nisha, and Lucy. 

HOW TO RUN OUR CODE: 
    
    Running Numpy Single-Layer Network: 
    
    In order to run the Numpy Single-Layer Network, please write: 
    
    python3 single_layer_model.py 
    
    
    Running Sequential Classification Neural Network 
    
    In order to run the Sequential Classification Neural Network, please write: 
    
    python3 cnn_three_classes.py

We have also included the numpy conversion files that we used in order to 
load our data into github. 

KNOWN BUGS: None! :) 

Thank you for grading our final project! Have a great winter break! :)
